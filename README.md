### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is a simple python code for Hartree-Fock SCF calculation. And you can set up the molecule with coordinates and basis sets manually, and obtain all one-electron and two-electrons integrals needed for HF-SCF calculation.

In my Raman_analyzer repository, I provided a scrip to analyze raman spectra. It specifically works for analyzing graphene raman spectra peaks ratios and hwhm data. It will feed the raman data to machine learning algorithm.
